# Contact Form Application

This is a simple **Contact Us** form built using React.js. It includes form validation, loading spinner during form submission, and success/error notifications with `react-toastify`. The form also features a beautiful, animated gradient background and responsive design for mobile users.

## Features

- **Form Validation**: Validates all fields before submission.
- **Email Validation**: Ensures that a valid email address format is entered.
- **Loading Indicator**: Displays a loading spinner when the form is being submitted.
- **Toast Notifications**: Shows success or error messages using `react-toastify`.
- **Animated Background**: The form has an animated gradient background for a modern look.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile screens with smooth transitions and responsive layouts.

## Installation

Follow the steps below to install and run this project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine
- A package manager like `npm` or `yarn`

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NalagamdinniRaju/SimpleFromWebPage.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd simpleFormWebPage
   cd client
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Fill in the form fields: **Name**, **Email**, and **Message**.
2. Click the **Submit** button to send the form.
3. If all fields are valid, a success notification will appear, and the form will reset.
4. If there are validation issues (e.g., empty fields or an invalid email), an error notification will appear.
5. During submission, a loading spinner will replace the submit button icon.

## Code Structure

- `App.js`: Main component that handles the form state, input changes, validation, and submission logic.
- `App.css`: Contains styles for the form, including animations and responsive design.

### Key Libraries

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/): Used for adding icons to the form fields and submit button.
- [React Toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/): Provides notifications for form submission feedback.
- [React Spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners): Used for displaying the loading spinner.
  
## Styling

- The form and its fields have a clean and modern design, with subtle hover effects and transitions.
- The background has a smooth, animated gradient, adding visual appeal to the page.
- Mobile responsiveness is implemented, ensuring a user-friendly experience on smaller screens.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Currently, the form simulates an API call. It can be integrated with a real backend service for sending the form data via email or saving it to a database.
- **Validation Improvements**: Add more comprehensive validation, such as checking for invalid characters in the name field.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Adding more form fields or integrating a CAPTCHA for spam prevention.
